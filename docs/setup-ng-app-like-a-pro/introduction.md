## A Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Enterprise-Level Applications 🚀

Welcome to my 2025 resolution to improve my Angular skills! This series will guide you through building a robust, scalable enterprise application with Angular. Each week, we'll focus on a specific aspect, ensuring practical, hands-on learning.

### What's Inside? 📚

Here's what we'll cover:

- **🚀 Week 1: Setting Up the Workspace**

    - 🛠️ Initialize NX workspace with Angular preset
    - 📂 Set up a structured monorepo with clear folder hierarchy
    - 🧹 Configure ESLint, commit lint, and Prettier for code quality
    - 🔗 Create and link GitHub repository with automated CI workflows
    - 📝 Write a README file with an overview of the project

- **🔧 Week 3: Module Federation and Host App**

    - 🏠 Set up the host application (Dashboard)
    - ⚙️ Configure module federation for dynamic imports
    - 🧭 Add basic navigation for micro-frontends
    - 📦 Create shared libraries for utilities and services
    - 🧪 Test communication between the host app and micro-frontends

- **📋 Week 5: Building the To-Do Micro-Frontend**

    - 🆕 Create a new micro-frontend for the To-Do application
    - 🖥️ Use PrimeNG for dynamic UI components
    - 🔄 Set up NgRx Signals for reactive state management
    - ✏️ Add task creation, editing, deletion, and completion functionality
    - ✅ Test and validate the micro-frontend independently

- **📊 Week 7: Developing the Grid Micro-Frontend**

    - 🗃️ Set up AG Grid for handling large datasets
    - 📈 Integrate Highcharts for real-time data visualization
    - ⚡ Optimize data fetching with TanStack Query
    - 🔍 Implement dynamic filtering, sorting, and pagination
    - 🧪 Test the micro-frontend with mock APIs

- **⚡ Week 9: Performance Tuning and Optimizations**

    - 💤 Implement lazy loading for modules and routes
    - 📉 Reduce bundle size with advanced build configurations
    - 🚀 Enable NX caching for incremental builds
    - 🔄 Optimize change detection with Angular Signals
    - 🧠 Analyze and reduce memory leaks in the application

- **📖 Week 11: Component Documentation with Storybook**

    - 📚 Set up Storybook for UI component documentation
    - 📝 Write comprehensive documentation for shared modules
    - ♿ Create accessibility tests for key components
    - 🖼️ Add interactive examples for PrimeNG and AG Grid components
    - 🌐 Publish Storybook to GitHub Pages for easy access

- **🔄 Week 13: Automation and Testing**

    - ⚡ Set up Vitest for fast and efficient unit testing
    - 🧪 Add end-to-end tests with Cypress for user flows
    - 🤖 Automate linting and testing in CI pipelines
    - 📝 Implement Release It for version management and changelogs
    - 📊 Ensure 90%+ code coverage across all micro-frontends

- **🛠️ Week 15: Advanced Features and Third-Party Integrations**

    - 🔄 Integrate SignalR for real-time updates in the app
    - 🌐 Implement server-side rendering for better SEO
    - 📊 Add Highcharts drilldown capabilities for detailed data exploration
    - 🗃️ Use TanStack Query to cache API results for offline capabilities
    - 🧩 Experiment with module federation across different repositories

- **🚀 Week 17: Deployment and Finalization**
    - ☁️ Deploy all micro-frontends and host app using Vercel
    - 🔧 Configure environment variables for production builds
    - 🧪 Perform stress testing to identify potential bottlenecks
