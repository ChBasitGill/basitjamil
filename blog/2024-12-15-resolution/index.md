# 2025 Resolution : Guiding the Community on Setting Up Enterprise-Level Applications

As 2025 approaches, I am thrilled to announce my upcoming project: a comprehensive guide on setting up enterprise-level applications. This initiative will be a cornerstone of my personal resolution to give back to the community by sharing knowledge and empowering others to build scalable, maintainable, and robust applications.

## Why This Project?

Over the years, I have had the privilege of working with cutting-edge technologies, solving complex problems, and contributing to enterprise-level solutions. However, I’ve noticed a gap in accessible resources for developers who want to embark on similar journeys, especially when it comes to setting up projects with best practices and enterprise-level standards.

In 2025, I aim to bridge that gap. This project will be an open-source initiative that serves as a step-by-step guide to help developers, teams, and organizations create high-quality applications from scratch.

## What Will This Project Include?

The project will focus on building an enterprise-ready Angular application, but it will also incorporate general practices that apply across different frameworks and technologies. Here’s a sneak peek at the key topics I’ll cover:

### NX for Workspace Management

- Setting up a monorepo using NX.

- Managing multiple applications and libraries efficiently.

- Leveraging NX tools for testing and builds.

### 2. State Management with NgRx

- Implementing NgRx for predictable state management.

- Structuring feature modules and effects for scalability.

### 3. Data Presentation with AG Grid and PrimeNG

- Using AG Grid for data-intensive applications.

- Building user-friendly interfaces with PrimeNG.

### 4. Micro Frontends with Module Federation

- Breaking down applications into independent, shareable modules.

- Configuring module federation for Angular projects.

### 5. Component Libraries with Storybook

- Creating a design system and reusable components.

- Documenting components for consistency and collaboration.

### 6. Automation and Quality Control

- Enforcing coding standards with commit linting and ESLint.

- Automating versioning and release notes using Release It.

### 7. CI/CD with Vercel

- Deploying applications with a reliable CI/CD pipeline.

- Optimizing build and deployment processes.

### 8. Developer Productivity

- Setting up VSCode with essential extensions.

- Tips and tricks for debugging, code navigation, and more.

- How Will It Be Structured?

- The project will be a multi-part series hosted on an open-source platform, with each part focusing on a specific feature or tool. Accompanying each post will be:

- Code examples: Real-world scenarios to demonstrate implementation.

- Commands and configurations: Step-by-step guides for setup.

- Tips and best practices: Insights from years of enterprise development experience.

## Why Open Source?

Open source has always been a powerful medium for collaboration and growth. By making this project open source, I invite developers from all backgrounds to contribute, learn, and innovate together. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or a beginner, there will be something valuable for you.

## Join Me on This Journey

This project is not just about me sharing knowledge; it’s about creating a community of learners and contributors. Together, we can build resources that will help developers worldwide deliver better applications.

If you’re as excited about this as I am, stay tuned! I’ll be sharing updates, previews, and milestones along the way. Let’s make 2025 a year of learning, sharing, and growing together.

Note: I will be uploading and adding links to this blog!
